Explanation:
User Interface (CLI): 
The user interacts with the system by inputting commands to enroll speakers, recognize a speaker, list enrolled speakers, 
or remove a speaker from the database.

File Management System: 
Handles storing and retrieving the audio files and related metadata (integrated with your existing system).
The File Management System is responsible for storing the actual audio files and associated metadata in an organized way, 
using your previously implemented file management structure (based on the BST for efficient access). 
Here’s what will be saved:

Audio Files (WAV files): The raw recordings of the speakers. 
For example, each user might have one or more audio files stored for enrollment.

Metadata for Each File:

file_id: Unique identifier (hash or other identifier for the file).
file_path: Path to the audio file.
file_timestamp: When the file was created/modified.
file_size: Size of the audio file.
file_type: WAV or similar.
access_frequency: How often this file has been used.
description: A description of the audio file (e.g., "Speaker A, Enrollment Audio 1").
These files and metadata help with file management (adding, deleting, and organizing raw audio).

Feature Extraction: 
Converts audio files into feature vectors (like MFCCs) which will be used by the GMM for training and recognition.

Speaker Modeling (GMM): 
This component trains a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for each speaker using the extracted features.
The Speaker Database is used to store the processed data from the GMM models, which are derived from the audio files during speaker enrollment. This data will be stored in serialized format (e.g., using pickle) and will be used for speaker recognition. Here’s what will be saved:

GMM Models for Each Speaker:
Speaker ID (or Speaker Name): A unique identifier for each speaker.
GMM Parameters:
Weights: The weights for each Gaussian component in the mixture.
Means: The mean vectors for each component.
Covariances: Covariance matrices for each Gaussian component.
Training Metadata: Data related to the training process, such as the number of iterations, date of training, and model version.
These models are used for matching new audio inputs with stored speakers' models during the recognition phase.

Speaker Recognition Logic: 
When a new audio file is provided, its features are extracted and compared with the GMM models to recognize the speaker.

Speaker Database: 
Stores the trained GMM models for all enrolled speakers, allowing retrieval during recognition.

Example file structure:
/base_directory/
    /configs/                  # Configuration files and system configs
    /models/                   # GMM models stored as serialized files
        speaker1_model.pkl      # GMM model for Speaker 1
        speaker2_model.pkl      # GMM model for Speaker 2
        ...
    /audio_files/              # Raw audio files
        speaker1_audio.wav      # Audio file for Speaker 1
        speaker2_audio.wav      # Audio file for Speaker 2
        ...
Process:
During Enrollment:
The raw audio is processed to generate a GMM model for the speaker.
This GMM model is serialized and saved as a file (e.g., speaker1_model.pkl).
The corresponding audio file (e.g., speaker1_audio.wav) is also stored in the file system for future reference or retraining.
During Recognition:
The system will load the serialized GMM models from the models directory to compare with the new audio input.
On Removal:
When a speaker is removed, both the serialized GMM model file and the corresponding audio file can be deleted from the system.


Feature Extraction Process Breakdown:
We can break the process into several clear stages:

Preprocessing the Audio:

Read the raw audio data (e.g., .wav file).
Normalize the audio data and remove any background noise (optional step).
Framing and Windowing:

The audio signal is split into short overlapping frames (e.g., 20-30 ms) since speech signals are not stationary.
Apply a window function (typically a Hamming window) to each frame to smooth the edges.
Fourier Transform:

Perform the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each frame to convert the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Mel Filter Bank:

Apply a set of triangular filters known as Mel filter banks to emphasize the perceptual importance of certain frequencies.
The Mel scale reflects how humans perceive pitch (frequency).
Logarithmic Compression:

Convert the power of each frequency bin into the logarithmic domain to mimic the non-linear human perception of loudness.
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):

Apply the DCT to the log Mel-filtered coefficients to reduce the dimensionality and produce the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Feature Post-Processing:

Sometimes features such as delta coefficients (rate of change of MFCCs) or energy coefficients are added to the feature vector.
Result:

A sequence of feature vectors representing each frame of the audio signal, ready to be used for GMM modeling.


Great! Let’s start by designing the Feature Extraction part of the Speaker Recognition Engine using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

Feature Extraction Overview:
Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw audio into a set of meaningful data points that can be used to build speaker models (in this case, GMMs). The extracted features provide a compact, efficient representation of the speaker's voice.

In speaker recognition systems, one of the most commonly used feature sets is Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Architecture Design for Feature Extraction:
Let's break down the Feature Extraction Sub-system using the steps involved in extracting MFCC features. 
Below is the block diagram of the feature extraction process.

Detailed Flow of Each Block:
Input WAV File:

Input WAV File: The system starts by taking an input audio file (typically a .wav file).

Pre-emphasis Filter:

Amplifies higher frequencies to balance the spectral energy.
Purpose: Prepares the signal by boosting high-frequency content to compensate for the nature of speech signals.

Framing:

Splits the continuous signal into small overlapping frames for localized frequency analysis.
Purpose: Analyzes the signal in small chunks to account for variations over time.

Hamming Window:

Applies a windowing function to each frame to reduce spectral leakage.
Purpose: Ensures smoother transitions at frame boundaries for accurate frequency analysis.

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):

Converts each frame from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Purpose: Allows frequency-based analysis by transforming the signal into its frequency components.

Power Spectrum (|FFT|²):

Computes the power spectrum, representing the signal's energy in each frequency band.
Purpose: Provides energy distribution per frequency, used for further frequency-based transformations.

Mel-Scale Filterbank:

Applies a set of filters to the power spectrum, designed to mimic the human auditory system.
Purpose: Emphasizes speech-relevant frequencies.
Logarithm & DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform):

Applies logarithmic compression and then DCT to the Mel-filtered signals.
Purpose: Reduces data dimensionality and decorrelates the features to form the final MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
Output MFCC Features:

Final set of features representing the speech signal for speaker recognition.

Suggested Modular Structure:
pre_emphasis.py:

Responsible for applying the pre-emphasis filter to the input signal.
framing.py:

Responsible for splitting the signal into overlapping frames.
hamming_window.py:

Applies a Hamming window to each frame.
fft.py:

Implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for converting the time-domain signal into the frequency domain.
mel_filterbank.py:

Implements the Mel-Scale Filterbank.
dct.py:

Implements the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to calculate the final MFCC coefficients.
feature_extraction.py:

A high-level module that ties everything together. 
It would import the individual components and run them in sequence to extract features from the raw audio signal.

Design of the Hamming Window
The Hamming window is a type of windowing function that reduces spectral leakage by tapering the edges 
of each frame before applying the FFT. The mathematical formula for the Hamming window is as follows:

w(n)=0.54-0.46cos(2πn/(N-1))
Where:

w(n) is the Hamming window value for sample 
N is the total number of samples in the window (frame size).
n ranges from 0 to N - 1
Purpose: The Hamming window reduces discontinuities at the edges of the frame, 
which would otherwise create artifacts in the frequency domain after applying FFT.

Key Points of Implementation:
The window should be computed for each frame, based on the frame size.
The window is element-wise multiplied with each frame before the FFT step.
